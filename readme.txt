The easiest way to display related content from your site

nrelate is not just another related posts plugin. Our patent-pending technology continously analyzes your website content and displays other related posts from your website.  This ultimately leads to higher page-views for your site, and a better user experience for your visitors.

Installing this plugin is as simple as activating it, and you can leave the rest to nrelate.  Once activated, the nrelate servers will immediately begin analyzing your website content and associating similar articles.  Of course, we provide an options page so you can fine tune the display.

There are four ways to display related content;
1)Automatically display before or after each post.
2)Use the [nrelate-related] shortcode in your post.
3)Drag the nrelate Related widget to your themes widget area.
4)Place the nrelate_related() function in your theme files.

Because all of the processing and analyzing runs on our servers and not yours, nrelate doesn't cause any additional load on your hosting account.
